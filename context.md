# GymBuddy App Development Context

## Current State
- Basic workout tracking functionality implemented
- Core Data integration for data persistence
- Ability to create and edit routines
- Ability to organize exercises into blocks
- Basic workout logging functionality

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Block-Based Set Management [IN PROGRESS]
**Description**: Moving set management from individual exercises to the block level for better UX.

**Current Implementation Details**:
- Exercise currently has: ~~sets~~, repsPerSet, ~~completedSets~~ attributes
- Block now has: sets, completedSets attributes
- Set management moved to Block level

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Core Data Model Changes:
   - ✓ Remove sets and completedSets from Exercise
   - ✓ Add sets and completedSets to Block
   - ✓ Keep repsPerSet in Exercise (as each exercise can have different rep counts)
   - ✓ Update relationships if needed

**Development Decisions**:
- Decided to skip data migration and start fresh with the new model
- This simplifies the implementation but means existing workout data will need to be re-entered

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update Core Data model to move sets from Exercise to Block
- [x] Update model classes to reflect new structure
- [x] Modify UI components to handle block-level sets
  - Updated EditBlockView to manage sets at block level
  - Added sets stepper to block editing
  - Updated exercise display to show only reps and weight
  - Added block summary section showing all exercises
- [ ] Update workout tracking logic

**Implementation Details**:
1. Core Data Changes Made:
   - Removed attributes from Exercise:
     - sets (Int16)
     - completedSets (Int16)
   - Added attributes to Block:
     - sets (Int16)
     - completedSets (Int16)
   - Kept in Exercise:
     - repsPerSet (Int16)
     - weight (Double)
     - other existing attributes

2. UI Changes Made:
   - EditBlockView:
     - Added number of sets stepper (1-10 sets)
     - Removed sets from exercise display
     - Added block summary section
   - RoutineViewModel:
     - Updated addExercise to remove sets parameter
     - Updated updateBlock to handle sets at block level
     - Improved exercise management logic

Next steps:
1. Update WorkoutTrackingView to handle block-level sets
2. Test the new functionality

### 2. UI/UX Improvements [PENDING]
- [ ] Improve navigation flow
- [ ] Add visual feedback during workout tracking
- [ ] Enhance exercise selection interface
- [ ] Add progress indicators

### 3. Data Management [PENDING]
- [ ] Add data export functionality
- [ ] Implement backup/restore features
- [ ] Add workout history visualization

### 4. Exercise Management [PENDING]
- [ ] Add exercise categories
- [ ] Include exercise descriptions
- [ ] Add support for custom exercises
- [ ] Include exercise history tracking

## Recent Changes
- Initial implementation of Core Data model
- Basic CRUD operations for routines and exercises
- Implementation of workout tracking functionality

## Known Issues
- Exercise set management needs to be moved to block level
- UI could be more intuitive for workout tracking

## Next Steps
1. Implement block-based set management
   - Create new Core Data model version
   - Update model attributes
   - Update model classes
2. Update UI to reflect new exercise/set structure
3. Enhance workout tracking experience

## Technical Debt
- Review and optimize Core Data queries
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Document code base
